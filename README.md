## About Car Damage Detection

Created a Car Damage Detection system with computer vision and deep learning. This system help us to identify the damage, damage location and severity to accuracies of 92%, 76% and 69% respectively. Trained by a pipeline of convolutional neural networks using transfer learning on VGG16. Deployed car damage detective web app with Flask and Bootstrap for real-time car damage evaluations. 

Image Dataset : 

## Aim

The rationale for such a model is that it can be used by insurance companies for faster processing of claims if users can upload pics and they can assess damage and severity from the car damage detective web app.
