## About Car Damage Detection

Created a Car Damage Detection system with computer vision and deep learning. This system help us to identify the damage, damage location and severity to accuracies of 92%, 76% and 69% respectively. Trained by a pipeline of convolutional neural networks using transfer learning on VGG16. Deployed car damage detective web app with Flask and Bootstrap for real-time car damage evaluations.
